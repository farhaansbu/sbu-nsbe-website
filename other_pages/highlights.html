          <h3> August 2024 </h3>
          <p> Our leadership was able to attend the NSBE Region 1 leadership conference where each
            member was able to attend workshops tailored for their respective positions. On top of this, 
            there were general leadership workshops, some of which were competitions. A Stony Brook 
            student won the improv public speaking competition. The chapter was also able to get the
            resources necessary to start a new NSBE Jr chapter that is now in development.
