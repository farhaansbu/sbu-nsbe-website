                NSBE showed me the value of networking, self marketing, and the skills I needed to succeed in my desired career. 
                I was able to secure an electrical engineering internship at Dupont, and a project engineering internship at Gilbane directly through NSBE. <span class="testimonial-quotes">”</span>

               Through NSBE, I’ve had the opportunity to connect with professionals across various fields and 
               meet exceptionally talented individuals within the community. One highlight of my NSBE 
               experience was participating in the 2024 BEYA convention, where I was fortunate enough to 
               receive an internship offer at Booz Allen through this event. I’m deeply grateful for all that NSBE

                Between our alumni, advisors, and collegiate members, I feel empowered being surrounded by
                 people of color who are driven towards their academic and professional ambitions. Since my 
                freshman year, Stony Brook's NSBE chapter has been a safe space for me to speak honestly
                 about my academic shortcomings and triumphs knowing that my peers will empathize with, 
                support, and guide me. This environment inspired me to step into the role of Senator and acting
                 Parliamentarian for our chapter in order to extend our impact to students such as myself on 
                campus and beyond. <span class="testimonial-quotes">”</span>
